Our first goal was to use our data on microplastics to krig so we could determine microplastic measurements in areas with a lack of information.

We initially tried to interpolate microplastic density across unsampled regions using kriging, a geostatistical technique that estimates values at unobserved locations based on spatial autocorrelation.

Ultimately, due to the highly irregular and sparse nature of the microplastic data, kriging did not perform well. The spatial distribution lacked a strong enough correlation structure, leading to unreliable interpolations. 

Thus, we decided to move on to time series analysis and can say at least in our preliminary analysis that there wasn't a strong correlation between distance and microplastic concentration.
