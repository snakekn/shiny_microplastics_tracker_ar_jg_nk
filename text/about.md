## Overview of the Shiny App

The goal of this project is to begin understanding the relationship of the population of coastal cities in the United States and the plastic pollution in the oceans in the same vicinity. 

### App features
- US Map of all Populations & Microplastics -- An interactive map of the United States showing platic pollution data in the ocean and coastal city population data
- Time Series: Microplastic Density by Season -- A time series analysis of microplastic density by season .... (STILL NEED TO UPDATE)
- Linear Regression: US Map of Analyzed Populations & Microplatics -- A linear regression analysis of the relationship between coastal city populations and microplastic pollution in the ocean ... (STILL NEED TO UPDATE)

### How to Use the App

1. Show microplastic samples and/or coastal city populations in the US map.
2. Filter for microplastics data by density or sample year/season.
3. View city population data and how they've changed with time.
4. View plastics pollution trends over time for the map area shown.

### Data Sources

This app uses plastics sampling data from NOAA and the US Census Bureau.
