## Overview of the Shiny App

The goal of this project is to start understanding the relationship of our cities and our pollution. 

The app provides the following features:
- Interactive U.S. map showing plastic data near coastal cities. 
- City population data and how it's changed over the years.
- Time series data on pollution samples over time.

### How to Use the App

1. Show microplastic samples and/or coastal city populations in the US map.
2. Filter for microplastics data by density or sample year/season.
3. View city population data and how they've changed with time.
4. View plastics pollution trends over time for the map area shown.

### Data Sources

This app uses plastics sampling data from NOAA and the US Census Bureau.
